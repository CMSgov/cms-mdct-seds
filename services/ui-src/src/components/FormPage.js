// TODO:
// copy base of page from examples.js
// inspect redux, is most of what is needed present
// connect to redux
// add subheader bar with links to the top of the page with quarter & home
// add form name to subheader bar
// make div for tab container to go in
// add tab container
// add button bar at the bottom (back, save, submit)
// just outside of the tab container area should be the heading "Number of CHIP Children Served, Separate Child Health Program"
// just outside of the tab container area should be the form description
// just outside of the tab container area should be program code, state and quarter
// make a question component that houses the table component- WITH question text
// consider where "isActive" property should be read to disable the entire page

// REDUX: does the App provider need to change locations to supply this page with all that it needs?

// LIST OF MISSING/DUMMY DATA:
// These things are currently being populated with dummy data but will need to be implemented eventually

// ASKS:
// Where is the "does not apply" meant to be put? it would be nice to remove it from the not found page
// Is there a ticket for implementing the summary tab functionality?
